# Final-Spring17CS331

This serves as a working directory for my submission for this section's final project.

Usage:
```
python main.py
```

### IMPORTANT: This was developed using Python 3.6, this program will not run if you attempt to run it with Python 2.

You can also execute the script itself from Explorer if you wish.

Recommended to store test files in a /tests/ directory and then enter the file with its directory.

For example, if I have a file test1.txt in tests/ directory and I want to use that, I would enter tests/test1.txt into the console.

This program outputs a total of three files:
* huff.hex is for retrieving the huffman tree.
* out.hex is for storing the encoded file.
* decoded.txt is the output, decoded text file.
