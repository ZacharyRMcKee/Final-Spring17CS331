# Final-Spring17CS331

This serves as a working directory for my submission for this section's final project.

Usage:
```
python main.py
```
You can also execute the script itself from Explorer if you wish.

Recommended to store test files in a /tests/ directory and then enter the file with its directory.

For example, if I have a file test1.txt in tests/ directory and I want to use that, I would enter tests/test1.txt into the console.

This program outputs a total of three files:
* huff.hex is for retrieving the huffman tree.
* out.hex is for storing the encoded file.
* decoded.txt is the output, decoded text file.
